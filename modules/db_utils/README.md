DB Utils
==
DB Utilities for testing should only be used by tests.

TODO
--
* Delete DB
* Recreate DB with base setup provided by uniserve + msp_ping record table
* Recreate DB with 1k devices, associated companies and locations with 30 minutes of ping record
* Recreate DD with 1k devices, associated companies and locations with full 30-60-90 day tables all filled out (we should figure out how much storage this is going to use first this might blow up peoples VMs)
