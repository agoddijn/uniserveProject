1. Rigth now the map resizes when 2 layout buttons are clicked(FIX!)
2. However the Infowindow does not responded right after a layout change/Wait for the next refresh for it to work(Need to Fix!)
3. A time fresh will not trigger a map rerendering
4. If the map window is dragged, nothing change(This is not detected by main)/Press one layout button and we are in step 1
