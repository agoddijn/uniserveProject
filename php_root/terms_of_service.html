              <p><strong>12.0 VoIP Service-Specific Provisions </strong></p>
              <p>12.1 <strong>THIS SECTION CONTAINS IMPORTANT PROVISIONS, INCLUDING THOSE REGARDING 911 ACCESS. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. </strong></p>
              <p>12.2 Description. VoIP Services allow the Customer to make or receive telephone calls over the Internet to or from the public switched telephone network (&quot;VoIP Calls&quot;). The nature of VoIP Calls, while appearing similar to traditional telephone calling services, create unique limitations and circumstances and the Customer acknowledges that differences exist between traditional telephone service and the VoIP Services, including the lack of traditional 911 services and other privacy issues. </p>
              <p>12.3 911 Service. Because of the unique nature of VoIP Calls, emergency calls to 911 through the VoIP Service (a &quot;911 Call&quot;) will be handled differently than traditional phone service. The following provisions describe the differences and limitations of 911 Calls: </p>
              <p>(a.) Placing a 911 Call. When an individual makes a 911 Call, the VoIP Service will attempt to automatically route the Customer&rsquo;s 911 Call through a third party service provider to the Public Safety Answering Point (&quot;PSAP&quot;) corresponding to the address on record with the Customer&rsquo;s Account. However, due to the limitations of the VoIP System, the Customer&rsquo;s 911 Call may be routed to a different location than that which would be used for traditional 911 dialing.<br/>
                For example, the Customer&rsquo;s call may be forwarded to a third-party, specialized call centre that handles emergency calls. This call centre is different from the PSAP that would answer a traditional 911 call, and the Customer may be required to provide the Customer&rsquo;s name, address, and telephone number to the call centre.<br/>
                (b.) How The Customer&rsquo;s Information is Provided. The VoIP Service will attempt to automatically provide the PSAP dispatcher or emergency service operator (a &quot;Dispatcher&quot;) with the name, address and telephone number associated with the Customer&rsquo;s Account. However, for technical reasons, the Dispatcher may not be able to capture or retain the Customer&rsquo;s name, phone number or physical location. Therefore, when making a 911 Call, an individual must immediately inform the Dispatcher of their location (or the location of the emergency, if different). If the individual unable to speak, the Dispatcher may not be able to locate the Customer.<br/>
                (c.) Correctness of Information. The Customer are responsible for providing, maintaining and updating correct contact information (including name, residential address and telephone number) associated to the Customer&rsquo;s Account. If the Customer does not correctly maintain or update this information, 911 Calls may be misdirected to an incorrect Dispatcher.<br/>
                (d.) Disconnections. The caller must not disconnect the 911 Call until told to do so by the dispatcher, as the dispatcher may not have the Customer&rsquo;s number or contact information. If the call is inadvertently disconnected, the individual must call back immediately.<br/>
                (e.) Connection Time. For technical reasons, including network congestion, it is possible that a 911 Call will produce a busy signal or will take longer to connect when compared with traditional calls.<br/>
                (f.) 911 Calls May Not Function. For technical reasons, the functionality of a 911 Call may cease or be curtailed in various circumstances, including: </p>
              <p>i.) Failure of Service or Service Access Device – if the Customer&rsquo;s Service Access Device fails or is not configured correctly or if the Customer&rsquo;s VoIP Service is not functioning for any reason, including in the event of power outage, VoIP Service outage, suspension or disconnection of the Customer&rsquo;s Service due to billing issues, network or Internet congestion, or network or Internet outage, in the event of a power, network or Internet outage, the Customer may need to reset or reconfigure the Service Access Device before being able to use the VoIP Service, including for a 911 Call; </p>
              <p>ii.) Changing Location of Service Access Device – if the Customer moves the Customer&rsquo;s Service Access Device to a location other than that described in the Customer&rsquo;s Account information or otherwise on record with UNISERVE; and, </p>
              <p>iii.) Use outside of Canada or the United States – if the Customer moves the Customer&rsquo;s System Access Device to a location other than one located in the USA or Canada (excluding Alaska, Hawaii, the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut). </p>
              <p>(g.) Alternate Services. If the Customer is not comfortable with the limitations of 911 Calls, UNISERVE recommends that the Customer terminate the Services or consider an alternate means for accessing traditional 911 services.<br />
              (h.) Inform Other Users. The Customer is responsible for notifying, and the Customer agrees to notify, any user of the Customer&rsquo;s VoIP Services of the nature and limitations of 911 Calls on the VoIP Services as described herein.<br/>
                (i.) No Liability and Indemnity. The Customer acknowledges that UNISERVE will not be liable for any service outage or inability to place 911 Calls using the Customer&rsquo;s VoIP Service or to access emergency service personnel due to the limitations of 911 service described herein. </p>
              <p>12.4 Privacy. The Customer acknowledges that VoIP Calls and VoIP Services utilize, in whole or in part, the public Internet and third party networks to transmit voice and other communications, which transmissions may be intercepted by other parties. </p>
              <p>12.5 411 Service. The 411 information service is available at UNISERVE's current rates as set by UNISERVE's web site, any changes to the said rate shall be subject to the Notice requirements outlined in Paragraph 24.6 below. </p>
              <p>12.6 900 and 976 Numbers. VoIP Calls to certain special service phone numbers, including 900- and 976- numbers, may be limited and UNISERVE reserves the right to limit the Customer&rsquo;s ability to call any such number at its discretion. </p>
              <p>12.7 Long Distance Services. Sections 13 and 14, relating to long distance service, are applicable to VoIP Services. </p>
              <p>12.8 Telephone Number Portability. The Customer may be able to transfer an existing telephone number to the Customer&rsquo;s VoIP Service or the Customer&rsquo;s VoIP Service telephone number to another service provider, provided that the Customer&rsquo;s Account is in good standing. However, UNISERVE will not be responsible for any termination fees imposed by any other service provider as a result of the Customer transferring or instructing UNISERVE to transfer the Customer&rsquo;s existing number to the Services. </p>
              <p>12.9 UNISERVE cannot guarantee or warrant the timeliness or date of any transfer, nor can it guarantee that the Customer will be able to transfer the said number. </p>
              <p>12.10 Directory Services. UNISERVE will make the Customer&rsquo;s name, address and telephone numbers available to publishers of paper and electronic telephone directories and to providers of operator services, in accordance with legal, contractual or regulatory requirements. </p>

UNISERVE reserves the right to terminate, curtail or suspend the Customer&rsquo;s VoIP Services if the Customer&rsquo;s calling patterns materially exceed the negotiated limits outlined in the Service Schedule or applicable SLA, or, if the Customer breach any part of this Agreement. </p>
              <p>12.12 Bandwidth Usage. VoIP calls require high-speed Internet bandwidth, which may affect throughput over any High Speed Services and will count towards the Customer&rsquo;s bandwidth usage for all High Speed Services. </p>

              <p>12.13 Specific Prohibitions. The Customer is prohibited from using any VoIP Services for: automatic-dialing announcing devices and unsolicited voice and facsimile calls made for the purpose of solicitation; or, any application with continuous or excessive calling patterns for telemarketing (including charitable and political solicitation and polling), fax broadcasting or fax blasting. </p>
